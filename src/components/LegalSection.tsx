            SahajPath is a supplementary educational diagnostic assessment platform. All 10-mark sprint examinations, AI step-by-step solutions, and topic mastery ratings are generated using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) calibrated against published public syllabi of CBSE, ICSE, ISC, Cambridge Assessment International Education, NCERT, and competitive exam guidelines (NEET/IIT-JEE). SahajPath is an independent educational platform and is not officially affiliated with or endorsed by CISCE, CBSE, Cambridge University Press & Assessment, or NTA. Diagnostic scores should be used as formative practice indicators alongside regular school instruction.

            Protecting school children (Classes 5 to 12) is our foremost priority. Child sub-accounts are strictly created, monitored, and mediated by a verified parent or legal guardian master account. We do not sell student response logs or personal information to third parties. Exam responses are utilized solely to construct student-specific knowledge graph mastery charts and to provide targeted educational reference links.
